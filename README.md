# Go in Kubernetes
Single node cluster orchestration for go application with minimum effort


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
1. Docker
2. Kubernetes

### Docker Installation
[Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Kubernetes Installation
Installion instruction for 
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and 
[minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

### Launching Kubernetes Cluster
We are using Single Node Kubernetes Cluster - `minikube`. For starting `minikube`.
```
minikube start
```


### Installation


#### Docker Image

``` dockerfile
# Accept the Go version for the image to be set as a build argument.
# Default to Go 1.11
ARG GO_VERSION=1.11


# First stage: build the executable.
FROM golang:${GO_VERSION}-alpine AS builder


# Git is required for fetching the dependencies.
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates git

# Set the working directory outside $GOPATH to enable the support for modules.
WORKDIR /src/github.com/shoeb240/go-in-kubernetes

# Fetch dependencies first; they are less susceptible to change on every build
# and will therefore be cached for speeding up the next build
COPY ./go.mod ./go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Import the code from the context.
COPY ./ ./

# Build the executable to `/app`. Mark the build as statically linked.
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build \
-installsuffix 'static' \
-o /app cmd/api/main.go

# Final stage: the running container.
FROM scratch AS final

# Import the compiled executable from the first stage.
COPY --from=builder /app /app
# Import the root ca-certificates (required for Let's Encrypt)
COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# Expose both 443 and 80 to our application
EXPOSE 443
EXPOSE 80

# Mount the certificate cache directory as a volume, so it remains even after
# we deploy a new version
VOLUME ["/cert-cache"]

# Run the compiled binary.
ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]

```

* Create docker image from Dockerfile
```shell
$ docker build -t go-built-app:1.0 .

* Check created docker images:
```text
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
go-built-app                               1.0                 2a34bf9f52fe        2 minutes ago       11.3MB
```

* Run Docker Image as a container 

``` text
docker run -p <host_port>/8081 go-built-app # If necessary Remove the container before moving on... 
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment

One of the most common Kubernetes object is the deployment object. The deployment object defines the container spec required, along with the name and labels used by other parts of Kubernetes to discover and connect to the application.

We will create container using image go-built-app in 3 pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: go-app
  labels:
        app: go-app

spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-app

    spec:
      containers:
      - image: go-built-app:1.0
        name: go-built-app
        volumeMounts:
          - name: my-host-path
            mountPath: /go/src

      volumes:
      - name: my-host-path
        hostPath:
          path: $GOPATH/github.com/shoeb240/go-in-kubernetes # please change it as your is going to be not the same as mine
          type: Directory
```


*Note*: You must change spec.template.spec.volumes.hostPath.path according to your codebase absolute path.

* Run kubectl command:
```
$ kubectl create -f k8s/deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions/go-app created
```

* Checking deployment and service
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
go-app   3         3         3            3           25s
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
go-app-5f55f4c977-6dkhr   1/1     Running   0          32s
go-app-5f55f4c977-6tg46   1/1     Running   0          32s
go-app-5f55f4c977-sprfb   1/1     Running   0          32s
Shoeb-Mac:go-in-kubernetes shoeb240$ 
```

We cannot yet access the app because port is not exposed outside world. We need to create service object for that.

#### K8s Service
Kubernetes has powerful networking capabilities that control how applications communicate. Service is assigned a unique IP address (also called clusterIP). 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: go-app-service
  labels:
    app: go-app
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 8081
    nodePort: 30081
  selector:
    app: go-app
```

* Run kubectl command:
```shell
$ kubectl create -f k8s/service.yaml
service/go-app-service created
```

The Service selects all applications with the label go-app. As multiple replicas are deployed, they will be automatically load balanced based on this common label. The Service makes the application available via a NodePort.

* Checking services
```shell
$ kubectl get service
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
go-app-service   NodePort    10.109.45.113   <none>        8081:30081/TCP   7s
kubernetes       ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          10d
```


Now we should be able to curl the go Service on `<CLUSTER-IP>:<PORT>`
```shell
$ curl localhost:30081/users
  I am responding to your API call
```


#### K8s Scalling
We can scale up to 4 replicas from 3 modifying `deployment.yaml` replicas field as `"replicas: 4"` and running the following `kubectl` command
```shell
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions/go-app configured
```

* Lets check deployment and pods
```shell
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
go-app   4         4         4            4           25m
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
go-app-5f55f4c977-6dkhr   1/1     Running   0          25m
go-app-5f55f4c977-6tg46   1/1     Running   0          25m
go-app-5f55f4c977-pzzfr   1/1     Running   0          41s
go-app-5f55f4c977-sprfb   1/1     Running   0          25m
```


### Troubleshooting
Lets see how to find out problem when our deployment is not successful. For instance, we can put wrong image version in `deployment.yaml`. Our image version is `1.0`, we can change it to `1.1` and create deployment again. Donot forget to delete previous deployment.

```shell
$ kubectl delete -f k8s/deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions "go-app" deleted
$ kubectl create -f k8s/deployment.yaml
deployment.extensions/go-app created
```

* Checking deployment. We see that available deployment is 0.
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
go-app   4         4         4            0           13s
```

* Checking pods, they are not ready and status shows ErrImagePull and ImagePullBackOff. So we realize that we have issue with image.
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
go-app-56577bc9d4-8gmhc   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          21s
go-app-56577bc9d4-gbhkt   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          21s
go-app-56577bc9d4-lb9c7   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          21s
go-app-56577bc9d4-r5274   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          21s
```

* To get more insight, we write command to describe pod
```
$ kubectl describe pod go-app-56577bc9d4-8gmhc
